### Introduction

In this challenge, you are a Experience Engineer at Launch Academy and have given the cohort a quiz on JavaScript. Now you need to show the students how the group did. To do this, you will build a JavaScript app that will calculate and display the cohort's results.


### Getting Started

Open up the terminal and use the following instructions to get started.

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges       # for Mac/Linux
$ cd %HOME%/challenges  # for Windows
$ et get quiz-app
```

Open the `quiz-app` **project folder** in your editor.

Open the `quiz-app/index.html` file in your browser.

Open the Developer Console with `Command + Option + J`


### Instructions

The cohort has taken the quiz and here are the results:

```
Mentor Group - JustReact
Rami: 88
Natoya: 92
Bill: 68
Susie: 100

Mentor Group - We Are Ruby
Sasha: 82
Mohammed: 98
Jennifer: 94
Ken: 92
```

Write some code in 'main.js' which will calculate the average score for each Mentor Group and for the cohort. Remember to round the averages to the nearest integer for display. Also calculate the number of students passing the quiz (grade >= 70%). To get started, declare a variable for each person and assign their score as its value. Then do your calculations with those variables. Finally, output the results to the console in a readable format.

### Submitting Your Code

Once you have completed this exercise, use the `et` command to submit your code
from this project's folder.

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges/quiz-app       # for Mac/Linux
$ cd %HOME%/challenges/quiz-app  # for Windows
$ et submit
```
