## Instructions

In this exercise, you will be building the very beginnings of an app that tracks Todo items.

In this exercise you are provided an `index.html` and a `main.js` file.

In `main.js`, create an array that will hold your ToDo list items. Populate your
list with a few items of your choosing. If you are feeling uninspired, here's a
list.

* Write some JavaScript
* Submit System Check
* Take a Break

Use this array to build a HTML unordered list, and insert it into the page. A
`ul` element with an id of `todo-list` has been provided.

{% show_solution %}
```
let todos = [
  "Write some JavaScript",
  "Submit System Check",
  "Take a Break"
];

let unorderedList = document.getElementById('todo-list');

todos.forEach(function(todo) {
  unorderedList.innerHTML += `<li>${todo}</li>`;
});
```
{% endshow_solution %}
